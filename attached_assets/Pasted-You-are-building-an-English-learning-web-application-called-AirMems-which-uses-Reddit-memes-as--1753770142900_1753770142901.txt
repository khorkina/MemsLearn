You are building an English-learning web application called **AirMems**, which uses Reddit memes as the foundation for interactive, personalized language lessons.

Below is a detailed feature specification and implementation guide. You must follow it exactly, with strict design and data-handling requirements.

---

üñºÔ∏è 1. **MEME FEED (infinite scroll)**

- Fetch memes from Reddit using either:
  - Reddit API (preferred), or
  - Meme API proxy (e.g. https://meme-api.com/gimme/EnglishMemes).
- Only use English-based subreddits like `r/EnglishMemes`, `r/memes`, `r/wholesomememes`, or similar.
- Display meme images in a vertically scrolling, infinite grid or list format.
- Each image must include the **source link** to the original Reddit post (e.g. `Source: reddit.com/r/memes/post/xyz`) below the image.

**Do not store or copy memes locally or in a database.** Only store image URLs, titles, and Reddit links in IndexedDB for caching purposes.

üéØ 2. **ON IMAGE CLICK ‚Äì MEME LESSON FLOW**

When a user clicks on a meme image:

1. They are redirected to a **Lesson Page**.
2. The meme is shown in large view.
3. A dropdown appears:  
   ‚Äúüß† Select your English level: [Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced]‚Äù

Once the user selects a level, the system sends a prompt to OpenAI to generate a **personalized lesson** based on that meme and user level.

üß† 3. **OPENAI PROMPT ‚Äì Lesson Generation**

Use this prompt for OpenAI (GPT-4, temperature = 0.7):

```plaintext
You are an expert English teacher who creates fun, effective language lessons using memes from Reddit.

The student is learning English at the [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED] level.

The meme text is:
"[Insert meme title or overlaid text here]"

Generate a personalized English-learning lesson in the following structure:

1. üîç Meme Explanation  
Explain the meme and why it's funny or culturally relevant, using language appropriate to the student's level.

2. üß† Vocabulary & Idioms  
List all relevant vocabulary, phrases, or idioms.  
Provide a clear, level-appropriate definition and one example sentence for each.

3. üìù IELTS-Style Interactive Exercise  
Create 3‚Äì5 interactive quiz questions (multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-gap, or true/false), based on the meme text or vocabulary.  
For each question:
- Provide the question text,
- 3‚Äì4 answer options,
- Mark the correct answer with a key.

4. ‚úÖ Answer Check  
Generate a functionally checkable list of answers with short explanations why the correct answers are correct.

Make your explanations engaging and supportive. Keep the tone light and encouraging.
üíæ 4. DATA STORAGE POLICY

The application must NOT use any external or server-based databases.

All data (meme metadata, user-selected level, lesson content, answers) must be stored locally using IndexedDB.

No user accounts. No cookies. No session data.

Everything must happen on the client side, stored temporarily or persistently in IndexedDB only.

üé® 5. DESIGN GUIDELINES (CoFi style)

The UI must strictly follow minimalist principles, inspired by the CoFi platform aesthetic.

Use the following design language:

Background: Light beige or off-white (#fdf6e3)

Accents: Soft brown (#8b6d5c), muted gray (#aaa)

Fonts: Use clean sans-serif typography (like Inter, Helvetica, or Nunito)

Buttons: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, minimal icons

Layout: Grid layout for memes, centered content on lesson pages

No unnecessary color. No gradients. Everything should look natural, soft, and easy on the eyes.

Animations: Smooth fade-ins, hover effects, subtle transitions.

üì± 6. RESPONSIVE & ACCESSIBLE

The app must be fully mobile-responsive.

All images must include alt text generated from the meme title.

All interactive elements (e.g. questions) must be accessible via keyboard.

üìå 7. LEGAL COMPLIANCE

Reddit content must always include the link to the original post.

Do not redistribute or resell images.

OpenAI content should be used only for educational purposes.

Avoid inappropriate, offensive, or NSFW memes (filter with keywords or moderation layer).

üîÅ 8. OPTIONAL FEATURES (future)

User can ‚ÄúSave‚Äù favorite memes to their IndexedDB.

Dark mode toggle.

Track lesson completion and difficulty level.

Your job is to follow this specification strictly, producing a fully functional prototype or web app component that can be later integrated into a bigger platform. Prioritize performance, simplicity, and clarity in user experience.

Do not require any server deployment. Everything must work in the browser.
